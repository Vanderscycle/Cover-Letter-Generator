I trained two Convoluted Neural Network(CNN), one to identify merchandise box and another one to read the price numbers, using the You Only Look Once (YOLO) model and created a spider to find the data as no dataset existed. I labelled the data using labelImg, transformed the data using ImgAug and stored all the data in a mongo database.",
